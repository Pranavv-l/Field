#Field
A private, local-first infinite canvas for dumping ideas.
Field is a minimal, performance-first thinking surface.
Paste anything — text, links, images — and it appears instantly on an infinite canvas. No folders. No tags. No accounts. No cloud.
Everything lives locally in your browser and persists automatically.
Movement is GPU-accelerated, interactions are trackpad- and mouse-first, and the UI stays out of the way so ideas can land without friction.
This project prioritizes:
Zero-friction capture
60fps pan & zoom
Local-first privacy
Calm, invisible UI
Imperative interaction over reactive re-renders
There is no organization system here by design.
